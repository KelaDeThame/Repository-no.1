<p>It was a mid summer breeze that I realised that something was different.
It was the cool air we'd receive during our regular summer and yet, 
I still felt a chill run down my body.
I couldn't place what was different.  Maybe it was the cold that we felt so little of, 
maybe it was the day.  The one thing I knew, something was wrong.<br>
<p>"Are you coming or not?"</p>
    It was Jaqueline that called me over,
my first real friend and my most reliable person to count on.s
